    priority         = 1
    max_instances    = 2
    cpu_limit        = 1024
    memory_limit_mb  = 8192
    storage_limit_gb = 65536
  }

  shared_resources = false

  administrators = ["jason@vra.local"]

  members = ["tony@vra.local"]

  viewers = ["shauna@vra.local"]

  operation_timeout = 6000

  machine_naming_template = "$${resource.name}-$${####}"

  constraints {
    extensibility {
      expression = "foo:bar"
      mandatory  = false
    }
    extensibility {
