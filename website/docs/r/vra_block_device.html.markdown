# Resource: vra_block_device
## Example Usages

This is an example of how to create a block device resource.

```hcl
resource "vra_block_device" "disk1" {
  capacity_in_gb = 10
  name = "terraform_vra_block_device1"
  project_id = var.project_id
  persistent = true
}
```

A block device resource supports the following arguments:

## Argument Reference
* `capacity_in_gb` - (Required) Capacity of the block device in GB.

* `name` - (Required) A human-friendly name used as an identifier in APIs that support this option.

* `project_id` - (Required) The id of the project the current user belongs to.

* `constraints` - (Optional) List of storage, network and extensibility constraints to be applied when provisioning through this project.

* `description` - (Optional) Describes machine within the scope of your organization and is not propagated to the cloud.

* `disk_content_base_64` - (Optional) Content of a disk, base64 encoded.

* `encrypted` - (Optional) Indicates whether the block device should be encrypted or not.

* `expand_snapshots` - (Optional) Indicates whether the snapshots of the block-devices should be included in the state. Applicable only for first class block devices.

* `purge` - (Optional) Indicates if the disk has to be completely destroyed or should be kept in the system. Valid only for block devices with ‘persistent’ set to true, only used for destroy the resource.

* `persistent` - (Optional) Indicates whether the block device survives a delete action.
