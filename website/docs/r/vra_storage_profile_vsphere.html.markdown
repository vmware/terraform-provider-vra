# Resource: vra_storage_profile_vsphere
## Example Usages
This is an example of how to create a storage profile vsphere resource.

resource "vra_storage_profile_vsphere" "this" {
  name = "vra_storage_profile_vsphere resource - FCD"
  description = "vSphere Storage Profile with FCD disk."
  region_id = data.vra_region.this.id
  default_item = false
  disk_type = "firstClass"

  provisioning_type = "thin"
  // Supported values: "thin", "thick", "eagerZeroedThick"

  datastore_id = data.vra_fabric_datastore_vsphere.this.id
  storage_policy_id = data.vra_fabric_storage_policy_vsphere.this.id
  // Remove it if datastore default storage policy needs to be selected.

  tags {
    key = "foo"
    value = "bar"
  }
}
